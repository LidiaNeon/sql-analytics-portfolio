# PostgreSQL DemoBase Practice

This folder contains SQL exercises and scripts based on the **official PostgreSQL airline demo database (PostgresPro)**.

The demo database includes real-like data on:
- flights  
- bookings  
- tickets  
- routes  
- segments  
- airports  
- airplanes  

These scripts are used to explore the structure, run analytical queries, and practice working with a production-style dataset.
